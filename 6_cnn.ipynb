    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural networks in previous notebooks were all constructed with fully connected layers, or dense layers. That is, each node in a layer connects to every node in the subsequent layer. It is expensive and slow to train a dense model, with one of the main obstacles being [vanishing gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) uses filters to scan across input domain and learn multiple distinct features. The total number of parameters needed for training is much lower than that of a fully connected neural network. CNN was initially developed for image classification, and later applied to learning tasks in other fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few main steps for constructing CNN:\n",
    "1. convolution\n",
    "2. nonlinear activation\n",
    "3. max-pooling\n",
    "4. classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is crucial to carry out a learning task. The convolution step can be braodly interpreted as edge detection, and max-pooling can viewed as sampling/dimension reduction. As we go through one convolution layer after another, learned edges can be combined into shapes to become representations of class labels. Below example is adapted from https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples.  "

    "The neural networks we tried above were all constructed with fully connected layers, or dense layers. That is, each node in a layer connects to every node in the subsequent layer. It is expensive and slow to train a dense model, with one of the main obstacles being [vanishing gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) uses filters to scan across input domain and learn multiple distinct features. The total number of parameters needed for training is much lower than that of a fully connected neural network. CNN was initially developed for image classification, and later applied to learning tasks in other fields. "
